A game about rock, paper and scissors

The game was finally done after months due to being busy with other stuffs.

Its main feature is a best of 5 (can be changed) of the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is played in the console. Once the 5 rounds are over, the winner is announced by the console.

Once I can use JavaScript as good as HTML and CSS, some modifications will be added to the game.

## 8/8/2023 UI-Update.

Added a CSS and JS files to begin with the remodel of this project.
